                            The aim of this project is work on front-end web development using Angular and Bootstrap web framework, specifically Material Design for Bootstrap and Angular (MDBA). I was required to create a website that displays the employees&apos; details by applying the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports. The Employee Details website was created using a specific template created by the DWA Team that is used by all Evonik websites. The first page of the website displays the employees list inside an Angular Datatable. The table contains the employee ID, name and position. The search bar is available to filter the input results accordingly and there are “Create New” button, “Edit” button, and “Delete” button to create, edit, and delete an employee respectively.
