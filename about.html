                    I am an independent person, passionate about programming, web development and mobile applications, good at problem-solving, adept at leading a team and working together in one. I am a software engineering graduate of Sunway University and Lancaster University, and currently doing my utmost to improve my programming and computing skills.<br><br>
                    As a software engineering graduate, I currently have intermediate knowledge and experience in various 
                    technical skills, including Javascript, Java, PHP, Python, Scala, and Typescript for programming languages, HTML, XML, CSS, React.js, and Angular for web development, MongoDB and MySQL for database management. I have also done several projects using the mentioned skills throughout the course.<br><br>
                    Prior to studying this course in Sunway University, I took a degree in automotive engineering in Germany. However, I had to stop my degree program there because I had to attend medical appointments in Malaysia.<br><br>
                    Since then, I have devoted my time by watching tutorial videos and practicing it during my free time and I 
                    could not stop because I enjoyed it a lot. From that moment, I was certain that software engineering was the 
                    right course to choose. Despite having to start from the beginning again, I was delighted that I had the
                    opportunity to actually complete in this course and perhaps to secure a future in this field.<br><br>
                    Now, I am enthusiastic to learn more and improve my skills, so feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
